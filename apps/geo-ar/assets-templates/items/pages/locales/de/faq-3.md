The application relays on your device's GPS signal and depending on it your location might not be accurate.

For example, if there’s something between you and cell towers, like a parking garage or tall buildings, your signal quality may be affected.

The app estimates your current location based on:

- GPS: Maps uses satellites to know your location up to around 20 meters. When you're inside buildings or underground, the GPS is sometimes inaccurate.
- Wi-Fi: The location of nearby Wi-Fi networks helps Maps know where you are.
- Cell tower: Your connection to mobile data can be accurate up to a few thousand meters.

IPhones handle location accuracy and calibration properly without any extra steps.

On Android you can improve your location’s accuracy by:

**Turn on high accuracy mode**

- On your Android phone open the Settings app Settings.
- Tap Location.
- At the top, switch location on.
- Tap Mode and then High accuracy.

**Calibrate your compass**

- On your Android phone open the Google Maps app
- If your location quality is low you should see a button 'Accuracy low tap to improve'.
- Click on calibration and follow the instructions provided by Google.
- Restart your phone

If the procedure above does not solve the problem try to:

- Delete your browser cache and history.
- Close and re-open your browser and or restart your phone
- Refresh the website.
