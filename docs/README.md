# Virtual Time Travel Geo-AR

The Virtual Time Travel GEO-AR is a simple AR-App based on geo location and device orientation. Within a geo fence it augments the device camera and guides you to the specific point of view (POV) by using GPS. Inside the POV the device orientation works as a compass to directs you in the intended line of view. An overlay window let you explore detailed information to your current point of view.

## About the German Romanticism Museum

The German Romanticism Museum presents unique originals with innovative exhibition forms that make it possible to experience the Romantic period as a key epoch. It is the first museum in the world dedicated to the Romantic era as a whole. In dialogue with the neighbouring Goethe House and the Goethe Gallery, manuscripts, graphic art, paintings and everyday objects are on display. The German Romanticism Museum offers a multimedia - in the Romantic sense synaesthetic - realisation of ideas, works and constellations of people. Goethe himself is put in a new light.

The German Romanticism Museum is supported by:

The Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, Hesse Ministry of Science and the Arts, City of Frankfurt am Main, Ernst Max von Grunelius Foundation, Deutsche Bank, Karsten Greve, Stiftung Polytechnische Gesellschaft, Kulturfonds Frankfurt RheinMain, Andrea and Carl-L. von Boehm-Bezing, Dirk Ippen, Wüstenrot Foundation, Art Mentor Foundation Lucerne, Dr Christoph Graf Douglas and Bergit Gräfin Douglas and many others.
