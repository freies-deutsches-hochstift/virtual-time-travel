# Deployment

**The app needs to be served through an HTTPS domain.** \
Webcam stream and other features are available only in a secure context.

The pre-build application does not require any particular server configuration.\
It is sufficient to directly upload the files of your build folder onto your server.

By requirement, the project does not include any CI or deployment scripts.\
If needed you can add them by following the [Nx documentation](https://nx.dev).
