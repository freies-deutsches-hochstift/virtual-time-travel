# Create your own App

You can fully customize your application by editing/adding your content and preferences in the folder:

**/assets** if you are using the prebuild application

---------- or ----------

**/apps/geo-ar/assets** if you are running the project on your machine.

The asset folder contains all assets and contents used by the application.

By default, the pre-build application comes with content and configuration examples.
